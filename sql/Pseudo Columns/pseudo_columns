### Pseudo columns
These are special types of column which are not physically stored in table.

Used in ranking and identifying unique rows.
When the tble information is unkown.
We cannot insert, delete or update pseudo columns.
if, user wants to see the pseudo columns, explicitly user must and should call the columns in select query.

Note: behaves like actual column but not stored in the table.


#### rownum
For each row returned by a query, the rownum pseudo column returns a number indicating the order in which selects the rows from a table.

it starts from 1 and increment by 1.

    used to limit number of rows retunrs in a query.
    it is dynamic.
    it is unique.
    can be used in select and where clause.
    rownum might change(dynamic) whenwe use order byclause in query.

```sql
select emp.*, rownum
from emp
where sal <=3000 and rownum <=2;
```

```sql
 select * 
 from (select * 
        from emp 
        where sal <= 3000 
        order by sal asc ) 
where  rownum <=2 ;
 ```

Get second row of emp by using rownum.
 ```sql
 select *
 from (select * 
        from emp 
        where rownum <= 2 
        order by rownum desc)
 where rownum=1;
 ```

```sql
select e.*, rownum r1
from (select emp.*, rownum r
        from emp ) e
where e.r in (1,5, 10, 12);
```



```sql
select e.*, rownum r1
from (select emp.*, rownum r
        from emp ) e
where e.r =(select count(*) from emp);
```
